## Test project cards


* newDeck: Code to make sure that a deck is created with x number of cards
* newDeck: Code to make sure that the first card is an Ace of Spades
* newDeck: Code to make sure that the last card is a four of clubs
* saveToDeck and newDeckFromFile: delete any files in current working directory with the name "decktesting", create a deck, save to file, load from file, assert deck lenght ..



Test create a new deck. Write if statement
to see if the deck has the right number of cards. 
If it doesn't, tell the go test handler that something went wrong.

Go testing is not RSpec, mocha, jasmine, selenium, etc...

To make a test, create a new file ending in 
```
_test.go
go test```
